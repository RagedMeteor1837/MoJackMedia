# Known Issues

- Using the "MoJack Media" text to go home does not work. This is expected due to differences between Github Pages hosting and regular web hosting.
- Firefox users may experience issues with the theme switcher displaying the wrong theme after closing and reopening the page. However, simply using the theme switcher will fix this issue.
